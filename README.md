# Pay To Win 

### Overview

Pay To Win is a game where players find glory, fame, and courageous battles with the of help of cold, hard cash. Players take on the role of bunnies vying for the mythical status of bunny-hero -- one reserved for only the strongest (and perhaps wealthiest) of all. May your path to the top be blessed with tenacity, skill, and microtransactions.

### Vision (Work in Progress)

Most gamers have witnessed the rise of a popular trend among mobile game developers who put invisible paywalls into their games via gameplay-affecting microtransactions, use psychological tricks to encourage players to spend more than they would otherwise, and desperately reach for your wallet at every damn opportunity. Pay To Win intends to respond to this trend by taking these subvertive practices and shining a light on them by making it an explicit theme. Aspects of this vision are: 
  * Pervasive transparency: Players know how the game motivates players to make microtransactions as well as how much players have spent in total on microtransactions. Players deserve to know the true cost of playing a game.
  * Ephemeral powerups: Microtransactions give a temporary bonus, never allowing high-spending 'whales' to permanently escape the rest of the pack in terms of overcoming challenges.
  * Low-cost barrier to entry: power ups are cheap. No single powerup should be more than, say, forty cents. 
  * David can beat Goliath: A player should always be able to win against another player through superior skill, even though the odds may be close to insurmountable. Occasionally winning against a player substantially better geared should bring a sense of Pride and Accomplishment (TM).
